Khloé Kardashian is ending the year on a high note.

On Instagram, she shared two pictures with long bangs in her brown hair.

"Bang Bang," the reality star captioned the photos. 

She received a lot of praise for her fringe. 

Fitzsimons wrote in the comments, "We did that.".  "Shots fired!" her best friend Khadijah Haqq McCray quipped, adding, "I love it!".

It looks amazing! My mom Kris Jenner wrote, "So GORGEOUS!!" and my sister Kim Kardashian gave her approval by saying, "I love this so much.".

Steph Shepherd wrote, "KHLOE!!!!!!!!!!! you better mess this up." after Kylie Jenner said, "yes.".

As a play on Khloé's caption, Scott Disick quipped: "Chitty Chitty mutha f---kaaaaa".

The mom of two paired her tousled beach waves with a soft makeup look by celebrity makeup artist Ash Holm, including flushed cheeks, nude lips, and bold lashes. 

At the People's Choice Awards, Kardashian had another major hair moment. As she was called onstage to accept her award, her outfit broke, and she had to be sewed back into it, messing up her perfectly styled hair. 

"I'm out of breath. I was fixing my hair, oh my god, a girl's gotta fix her hair," she joked onstage.
