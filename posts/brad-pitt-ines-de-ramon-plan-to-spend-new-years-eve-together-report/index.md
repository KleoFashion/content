Ines de Ramon and Brad Pitt might kiss at midnight.

According to a source who spoke to People on Friday, the couple plans to spend New Year's Eve together.

In addition, a close friend of the jewelry executive told me, "Ines said that Brad is a very sweet person."."

As the outlet reported, another source downplayed the romance to the outlet, telling them, "It's not serious yet, but he's nice to her and they're having fun together.".

A rep for the movie star didn't respond right away.

In recent months, Pitt, 58, has been in a relationship with Ramon, 29, who is 29 years old.

There was a report in People Magazine previously stating that the couple met through a mutual friend, and that the "Bullet Train" star is "really into" the health coach.

In November, the two were spotted together at a Bono concert.

Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber and Sean Penn were also spotted with Pitt and Ramon.

During the images, the "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" star was seen holding hands with the fitness enthusiast and putting his hands on her shoulders at one point.

In addition to the subtle PDA, Pitt and Ramon were once again seen getting cozy at an afterparty for the premiere of the Oscar winner's new movie "Babylon" last week.

"Fight Club" star and brunette beauty were occasionally seen holding hands at the event, according to People.

The couple is reportedly not exclusive, despite things heating up.

Former "Vampire Diaries" actor Paul Wesley was previously married to De Ramon, vice president of Anita Ko Jewelry.

Separation was announced by the former couple in September.

According to reports, Pitt has been divorced from Angelina Jolie since the beginning of 2019, and has been linked to Emily Ratajkowski recently. His previous marriage was to Jennifer Aniston from 2000 to 2005.
