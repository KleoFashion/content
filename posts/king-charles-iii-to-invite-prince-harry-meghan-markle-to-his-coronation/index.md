There is a high road being taken by King Charles III.

The Daily Mail reported Friday that the newly crowned monarch, 74, will extend an olive branch towards his youngest son, Prince Harry, and his wife, Meghan Markle, by inviting them to his coronation on May 6, 2023.

According to the outlet, Charles told the Duke and Duchess of Sussex they are welcome to attend the historic event at Westminster Abbey in London, although invitations have not been sent.

Harry is his son, and His Majesty will always love him. 

In spite of the fact that things are tough at the moment, the door will always remain open.

According to another source, it is unlikely that the invitation will be revoked, despite the upcoming release of Harry's memoir, "Spare."

On Harry and Markle's son Archie's 4th birthday, the coronation will take place.

It was previously believed that the date had nothing to do with Sussexes.

"The date was chosen because it's just before the state opening of Parliament and Charles will want to appear as King with his crown and ceremonial robes," Tom Bower, author of "Revenge: Meghan, Harry, and the War Between the Windsors," told us.

It's been suggested that Charles strip the Sussexes of their titles, which were bestowed on them by Queen Elizabeth II on their wedding day in 2018.

Piers Morgan urged the king to act after Harry and Markle's Netflix docuseries, "Harry & Meghan," released.

As he tweeted on Monday, king Charles needs to strip these two poisonous rats of all remaining titles and ties to the monarchy before they destroy it.

This move, however, is highly unlikely, according to a royal expert. 

It's unlikely that the king would strip their title ... mostly because it would be petty and punitive.

It would only lead to the Sussexes claiming it was retaliation and proof they didn't belong in the royal family."

Markle, 41, and Harry, 38, both expressed dissatisfaction with royal life in the documentary. 

He described how his father and brother, Prince William, scolded him when he told them that he wanted to step away from royal duties and move to North America with his wife and son.

"Having my brother scream and shout at me, my dad saying things that just weren't true, and my grandmother just sit there and take it all in was terrifying," he said.

In addition, Harry revealed he felt distanced from King Charles III after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997, and was raised instead by his "second family" in Africa.

A complete stream of all six episodes of "Harry & Meghan" is now available on Netflix.
