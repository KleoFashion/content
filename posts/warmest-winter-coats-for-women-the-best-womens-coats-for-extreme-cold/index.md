The best winter coats for women
-------------------------------

Choosing a winter coat depends on where you live and how cold it is. The style of the coat may be the most important consideration for you. If that is the case, then I would definitely recommend that you take a look at the best winter coats for women that are available. 

Nevertheless, when the weather is really cold, you'll need a coat that's both practical and stylish. The following are some key considerations to keep in mind.

Down or insulated parkas tend to be the warmest options for you. Not only are these coats warm, but they're also very trendy right now.

In order to find a coat that can handle extreme temperatures, there are a few things to consider
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### There is a filling in the cavity

Because down creates little pockets of air, it is often the warmest filling to choose.

Adding color to her black outfit is Claudia @glamupyourlifestyle above (read her style interview here).

### What's best?

You might be able to move more freely if the length is shorter, but the length will keep you warm if it is longer.

### Creating a flattering look for women's warm coats

It is important to note that some of the warmest jackets you can pick are not always the most flattering, since they tend to be quilted or puffy in design. It can make you look bigger.

It is still possible to create a pleasing silhouette by keeping the rest of your outfit in balance. Alternatively, you can look for styles with belts or that nip in at the waist to avoid adding unwanted bulk.

Another well-known brand for cold weather is The North Face. One factor to consider when choosing a down jacket is the down fill number, which usually ranges from 500 to 900. Warmer coats have more down fill.

### Puffer jacket by Everlane with long sleeves

I love Everlane for casual basics. There's a hidden cinch in the waist of the long puffer below, so you can draw the waist in more flatteringly. 

High quality and warm, say reviewers. Because it's oversized, you may want to size down depending on how you like it.

### Inolay

In fact, Orolay's thickened jacket is so popular that it has its own fan-based social media accounts. I get it. The jacket does have the same look as a designer jacket, but for a fraction of the price.

People said they bought it because it was different. She said she was looking forward to winter now that she had a coat that was so warm.

### Puff of the marmot

Another option with a zip off hood is the Marmot Montreal jacket (below), which has 700 down fill. According to reviewers, the jacket kept them warm even in temperatures as low as -15 degrees Celsius. There has been a consensus that it runs small, so it may be best to size up.
