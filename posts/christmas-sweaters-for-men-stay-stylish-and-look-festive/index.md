There should be a Christmas sweater in every man's closet. It used to be that all Christmas sweaters were bright, gaudy, and ugly. 

There is a wide variety of styles and colors of Christmas sweaters available today for men who wish to remain stylish and look festive. 

Here are some tips on choosing the right Christmas sweater and still looking sharp in today's article.

Don't wear a Christmas sweater with mismatched colors
-----------------------------------------------------

Christmas sweaters aren't exactly known for being subtle. This time of year, sweaters that suit the festive season offer a range of colors:

* Cherry Red
* Holly Green
* Brilliant White
* Silver & Gold

These colors don't always make a man look stylish, however. It's easy to walk around looking like a walking Christmas tree if you're not careful. It is important to match your sweater with your outfit carefully to avoid this.

Keep the rest of your outfit consistent with the sweater's colors. Wear a green and red sweater with dark jeans and a red scarf, for example. Wear a white and silver sweater with black pants and silver jewelry.

Colors should not be overdone. It is important that you look festive, not like a walking rainbow.

Your Christmas sweater should be made up of timeless patterns

Staying with timeless patterns is another way to make your Christmas sweater look stylish. Whether it's stripes, plaids, or solids, classic patterns are always in style. Best of all, they can be dressed up or down.

For a Christmas sweater you can wear year after year, choose timeless and classic patterns.

You can also wear sweaters with Christmas-themed patterns. Snowflakes or reindeer are what I'm talking about. Make sure the pattern is small and subtle if you go this route. You do not want to appear as if you are wearing a Christmas decoration.

Take fewer pictures
-------------------

Avoid sweaters with too many pictures on them as another tip for choosing a stylish Christmas sweater. Specifically, I am referring to sweaters with huge Santa Claus faces or reindeer on the front. It's hard to style these sweaters, not to mention they look tacky.

Too many pictures or embellishments can make sweaters look tacky and juvenile.

If you want to avoid looking like a walking Christmas card, choose a sweater with a simple design and minimal graphics.

Subtlety is the key, as I mentioned earlier. You are not prohibited from wearing a Christmas sweater with Christmas imagery - 'tis the season, after all! In spite of this, I would like to remind you that you need to take note of the size and style of those images. 

There is a world of difference between a sweater with tiny Santa heads on a muted gray background, and a sweater with Santa's headshot plastered across the front of it on a bright red background.

Fitting Your Christmas Sweater is One of The Most Important Things You Can Do
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to choosing a Christmas sweater, a good fit is one of the most important things to consider. You want your sweater to flatter your figure, not make you look fat. To ensure a good fit, try on sweaters before you buy them.

Fitting sweaters? Don't let it get too baggy, don't let it get too tight.

It is a common misconception among guys that baggy sweaters hide their rounder figures. Some guys who are carrying a bit of extra weight around the middle tend to cover it up by wearing clothing that is baggy. Guys, I'm here to tell you that you're not fooling anyone. There is actually evidence to suggest that baggy clothing makes you look fatter than you actually are.

While many guys opt for skinny-fit sweaters, which fit their bodies like saran wrap. Despite showing off your physique, these sweaters are not always flattering. If you are looking for a sweater (or any clothing, really), you want something that is both fitted and baggy.

You can tell if a sweater is too baggy or tight by asking yourself: can I move my arms and shoulders comfortably without the sweater riding up? The sweater is either too loose or too tight if the answer is no.

As an alternative, you can ask yourself: Am I wearing a shirt that looks like I'm wearing a 5 man tent? There is a likelihood that the sweater is too baggy if the answer to the question is "yes".

This holiday season, look stylish by wearing a well-fitted Christmas sweater. Sweaters should fit comfortably over your shoulders, not hug your stomach and hips, and allow you to comfortably raise your arms.

Keep the slogans to a minimum
-----------------------------

In addition, if you want to choose a stylish Christmas sweater, you should keep any slogans or sayings to a minimum if you want to keep it stylish. The sweaters with slogans like "Ho Ho Holy Night" or "Baby It's Cold Outside" come to mind.

These sweaters may be festive and fun, but they're not exactly stylish.

In spite of this, I believe that it really depends on where you intend to wear your Christmas sweater. In case your workplace organizes a Christmas sweater day, then you may want to choose a sweater without any slogans to make the day as festive as possible. 

Don't wear 'Kiss Me Under The Mistletoe' on your sweater, your boss won't like it. There's a workplace drama waiting to happen there, that's for sure.

The truth is, though, it isn't the worst thing in the world if you are visiting family over the weekend and want to add a bit of Christmas fun to the event, then opting for a timeless slogan might not be the worst choice. Specifically, I am referring to slogans such as "Jingle All The Way" or "Let It Snow". Everyone knows and loves these phrases, so they'll definitely make you laugh. 

It's okay to use a few small slogans, but don't go overboard.

Enjoy!

It's Christmas time! During this time of year, you can wear brighter colors and novelty patterns without looking weird.

I'm not here to tell you to never wear a loud and proud Christmas sweater. You can wear a bright green sweater with a giant Rudolph on the front if that is what you want to do. You should only wear it on special occasions (such as Christmas parties) and balance it out with more low-key clothing.

Above all else, have fun with your sweaters and enjoy the holidays!
