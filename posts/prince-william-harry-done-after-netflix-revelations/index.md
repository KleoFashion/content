At Princess Kate's carol concert on Thursday, King Charles, Queen Consort Camilla, and Prince William all attended the "Together at Christmas" event.

They weren't all together, of course.

After Netflix's docu-series finale, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were at their $14.5 million home in Montecito, Calif. 

Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a series of bombshell claims against the royal family during the last three episodes, including Prince Philip's death and family time with their children, Archie, 3 and Lilibet, 1.

When Harry, 38, tells the story of William, his older brother who he had depended on for most of his life and who, before his marriage to Markle, was his closest confidant, the most heartrending moments occur.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have quit the royal family, and Harry says William screamed at him in front of Queen Elizabeth. William also broke a vow the brothers had made not to pit their offices against each other in the press. According to Harry, William, the heir to the throne, is stuck in the "institution" into which they were both born.

"I think that's it," a well-placed royal source told Page Six. “It's done.”

William is taking Harry's comments "very personally," according to the Daily Mail.

In response to the photos of the royal family smiling at Westminster Abbey on Thursday, the royal source said: "The photos of the family all together said everything, while Harry and Meghan were distanced, sad, bitter back in Montecito."

As part of the series, Harry also admits that his friendships had changed after he left the UK and that he missed "the weird family gatherings" - even though he adds that his mother, Princess Diana, had loved the US and would have "potentially" ended up living here had she not died so soon.

Despite only meeting Tyler Perry months before Lili was born, the couple made him the godfather for their daughter. An insider asked, "Do they have any real friends, or is it just Oprah Winfrey?" "They seem isolated."

As a result of this speculation, a royal source speculated that Markle, 41, may not be aware of the extent of the fractures in the royal family. There is a tendency for Meghan [who has half-siblings] to see herself as an only child and I think she does not understand the dynamics of having siblings.".

One socialite who knows the Sussexes well said that Markle had contacted William several times after moving to the US, but had been rebuffed. 

The socialite told Page Six that William wanted to speak to Harry directly, not through Meghan.

Kensington Palace did not respond to a request for comment.

As the Sussexes left the UK and royal life behind, they filmed footage for the docu-series using their own phones.

Behind the scenes, as Page Six previously revealed, the couple attempted to edit chunks of the show, directed by Liz Garbus, after the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September.

The show premiering so close to the Queen's passing worried them, but the reaction would have been the same no matter when it aired," a Netflix insider said.

A second Netflix source said: "Harry and Meghan made promises to Netflix that they wouldn't step on their toes, but then they wanted to push it back and cut bits out. Netflix refused.

We have reached out to Netflix for comment.

One scene that the couple may have wanted deleted was the part where Harry, who fought two wars as a British soldier, describes being "terrified" when he hears his brother "scream and shout" at him at the Sandringham Summit, a meeting called to discuss the future of Harry's monarchy.

Additionally, he accuses his father, King Charles, of saying things that "weren't true" while the late queen just "sat there and took it all in".

Harry - who says he and Markle offered to give up their royal titles - claims he was given five options, including staying. He selected the "half in, half out" option, which meant they would work independently and support the queen at the same time.

My brother is now on the institution's side, which was the saddest part of the meeting, Harry says. "A part of that, I get, right, that's his inheritance. To some extent, it's already ingrained in him that part of his responsibility is the survival and continuation of this institution, and so, to some extent, I get that.

As Markle recalls meeting Kate for the first time, barefoot and wearing ripped jeans, and embracing her, the episodes are full of jibes directed at William and the Princess of Wales.

"I've always been a hugger, like I've always been a hugger," Markle adds. There must be a lot of Brits who find that jarring."

A friend of the Waleses told People magazine this week that Kate is "a big hugger. She's warm and friendly and greets everybody with a big hug and kiss."

One of the most damning moments in the series occurs when the Sussexes accuse William of organizing a plot to have their former communications chief fight against them. During their legal privacy lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday, the couple learned that Jason Knauf, the ex-rep who also worked in William's office, had provided a witness statement and texts from Markle.

After discovering the statement made by Knauf, a distraught Markle tells Harry on camera: "So how do we deal with that? It's your brother. I won't say anything about your brother, but it is so obvious ... ".

Upon being asked about claims that he submitted a witness statement under William's direction, Knauf's rep said: "These claims are entirely false."

Harry and Meghan do not want to be cut off completely. According to a royal insider who knows the Sussexes, Meghan feels strongly about what she perceives to be an agenda against them, and she is trying to clear her name — to tell the truth.

As for Page Six, it has been reported by multiple sources that William and Kate have no plans to view the Netflix show themselves, and will have aides view it instead. Following Queen Elizabeth's death in September, when Harry and Markle toured tributes to the monarch outside Windsor Castle — at the Waleses' behest — they never spent much time together.

Page Six previously reported that King Charles is believed to want Harry and Markle to attend his coronation in 2023, and it is unlikely that he will strip them of their titles.

The prince confessed to Oprah Winfrey that he's in a space with William right now, but added that he "loves William to bits - we've been through hell together.".

On January 10, Harry's memoir, "Spare," will be released, with doubtless more allegations against the royals.

"How can you talk about your only sibling like that on TV?" asked the well-placed royal source.
