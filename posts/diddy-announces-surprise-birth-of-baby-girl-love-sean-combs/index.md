Combs announced on social media Saturday that he has welcomed a new child.

Announcing the birth of his daughter Love Sean Combs, the 53-year-old music mogul tweeted, "I'm so blessed to have the opportunity to welcome my daughter to the world." He then commended his mom and other children.

He added, “Mama Combs, Quincy, Justin, Christian, Chance, D'Lila, Jessie and I all love you so much!”.

It is unclear if Diddy is the father or grandfather of the child.

In May, the "I Need a Girl" entertainer confirmed that he was dating City Girls rapper Yung Miami.

“We date. We're dating. We go on dates, and we're friends. We travel, we have great times, we go to strip clubs, we go to church,” he said on June's “Caresha Please” series.

This is due to the fact that Yung Miami, whose real name is Caresha Brownlee, has not appeared pregnant in any recent social media posts, which has added to the confusion.

However, the couple have made it clear that they are not in an exclusive relationship with each other.

The "Twerkulator" rapper told XXL in September that he sees other people outside of him. "I'm young. I'm dating. I'm having fun. I'm just being me. He's the same."

As Yung Miami, 28, explained, "I cannot speak for what he is doing or who he is dating, but we are singles and we are dating. We are dating, but we are single.

"I think it just went over people's heads, you know? People just like to take whatever they want out of whatever they get from time to time."

From previous relationships, Diddy has six older kids. 

The late Kim Porter's eldest son, Qunicy, 31, was adopted by him. Besides Christian, the former couple had twin daughters Jesse and D'Lila, both 15 years old.

Besides Justin, 28, the founder of Revolt TV also has a daughter Chance, 16, and an ex-wife, Sarah Chapman.
