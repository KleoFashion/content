Cher’s mother, Georgia Holt, has died after battling illness for several months. She was 96.

The singer confirmed the sad news Sunday morning, tweeting, “mom is gone,” with a sad face emoji.

Page Six has reached out to reps for Cher for comment.

The tragic death comes three months after the “Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again” star told fans that her mother had been hospitalized with pneumonia.

“Sorry I’ve Been Mia. Mom’s Been Sick Off & On. She Just Got Out Of Hosp. She Had Pneumonia,” she wrote in September. 

Cher later added, “She’s Getting Better.”

Over the past several years, the singer, 76, said she’s been extremely “careful” not to contract COVID-19. 

“We have a little bubble that we’ve had all this time,” she told People in 2020, while speaking about her mother’s health.

She added, “I have to be careful too because I have asthma. … I have different health problems.”

Holt, who was an actress, model and singer, was born in Arkansas in 1926 to mother Lynda Inez Gulley, who was just 13 years old at the time she gave birth.

She even recorded an album, “Honky Tonk Woman,” in the 80s, but it wasn’t released until 2013.

Cher has previously revealed some of the lessons she learned about life and love from her mother.

“Instead, we learned about life by listening to her talk about the things she did wrong and the things she did right.”

Cher also revealed that Holt initially took issue with her first husband, Sonny Bono. 

“I had a little problem with her over Sonny, but that didn’t take her too long to get over,” she added at the time. 

“She listened first before making a judgment, so I could always talk to her about my romances.”
