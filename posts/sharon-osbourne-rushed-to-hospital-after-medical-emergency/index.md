Page Six can confirm that Sharon Osbourne has been hospitalized following a medical emergency on set for a new television show.

According to TMZ, the former "Talk" co-host, 70, "fell ill" while filming at the Glen Tavern Inn in Santa Paula, Calif., on Friday.

Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson told TMZ that they received a "medical call" from the tavern around 6:30 p.m.

According to reports, Osbourne was taken to Santa Paula Hospital. 

The current state of her health is unknown.

In response to Page Six's request for comment, Osbourne's representative did not respond immediately.

She hadn't talked about any major health struggles recently, so it's unclear what caused the former "X Factor" judge to get sick.

Osbourne revealed in May that she had COVID-19.

She posted a photo of herself receiving IV drips and giving a peace sign.

Following this, Osbourne returned to television appearances in the UK.

She was tending to her husband, Ozzy Osbourne, after his "life-altering" back surgery over the summer.

Sharon wrote via her Instagram Stories in June, "We appreciate the love and support we have received leading up to Ozzy's surgery."

Your love means the world to him. Ozzy is doing well and on the road to recovery.

Since 1982, Sharon and Ozzy have been married.
