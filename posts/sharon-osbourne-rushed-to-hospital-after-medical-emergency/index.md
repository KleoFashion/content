A medical emergency has forced Sharon Osbourne to be hospitalized, Page Six can confirm.

According to TMZ, the former "Talk" co-host, 70, became ill while filming for a paranormal show at the Glen Tavern Inn in Santa Paula, Calif.

At around 6:30 p.m. local time, the Ventura County Fire Department got a "medical call" from the tavern.

A hospital was reportedly called for Osbourne. 

We don't know what her medical condition is right now.

The representative for Osbourne did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Page Six.

Due to the fact that the former "X Factor" judge has not spoken about any major health problems in the near future, it is unclear what might have caused her illness.

According to Osbourne, she contracted COVID-19 in May.

Her photo at the time showed her receiving IV drip aid while giving a peace sign.

Ozzy was back on TV in the UK soon after.

She had actually been attending to her husband, Ozzy Osbourne, after a "life-altering" back surgery over the summer.

Sharon wrote via her Instagram Stories in June that her family was grateful for the overwhelming support and love they received in anticipation of Ozzy's surgery.

"Ozzy is doing well and he's on the road to recovery! Your love means the world to him and he will never forget it."

They've been married since 1982.
