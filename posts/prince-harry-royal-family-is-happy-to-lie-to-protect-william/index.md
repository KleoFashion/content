Prince Harry says his family was more than “happy to lie to protect” Prince William but failed to look out for him.

The official trailer for the second half of Netflix’s “Harry & Meghan” shows the Duke of Sussex and his wife, Meghan Markle, reflecting on their decision to quit their duties and flee to California, describing their plane’s departure out of the UK as a “freedom flight.”

“To see this institutional gaslighting,” Harry, 38, begins before footage cuts to Markle, 41, who says, “I wasn’t being thrown to the wolves, I was being fed to the wolves.”

The trailer goes on to claim that the royal family were “practically recruiting people” to disseminate false stories about the couple.

“They were happy to lie to protect my brother, but they were never willing to tell the truth about us,” Harry says.

The new clip then shows footage and photos of the Sussexes and their two children, Archie, 3, and Lilibet, 1, living a life of happiness in Montecito, where they’ve since established their lives.

“It gave us a chance to create that home that we had always wanted,” Markle says.

“I’ve always felt as though this was a fight worth fighting for,” Harry adds.

Despite the trailer suggesting the pair wanted to flee London because of lack of privacy and protection, they defended themselves, claiming they never said that was the reason.

“Their statement announcing their decision to step back mentions nothing of privacy and reiterates their desire to continue their roles and public duties,” Harry and Markle recently told the New York Times via their press secretary, Ashley Hansen. 

“Any suggestion otherwise speaks to a key point of this series,” the spokeswoman added.

“They are choosing to share their story, on their terms, and yet the tabloid media has created an entirely untrue narrative that permeates press coverage and public opinion. The facts are right in front of them.”

The first three episodes of the docuseries premiered Dec. 8, and the second three will stream this Thursday, Dec. 15.

The first half followed the pair along their courtship, which began after the redheaded royal saw the American actress on Instagram in 2016, and homed in on his low-key proposal in 2017. The upcoming episodes, meanwhile, will address Harry’s years-long feud with William, 40, as well as his and Markle’s sensational royal exit.
