Strong opinions inside ABC News over “GMA3” hosts Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes’ off-screen affair have gone primetime. 

As network execs mull over the anchors’ fate amid their scandalous romance, sources tell Page Six that Robach’s “20/20” co-anchor David Muir “wants no part” of the drama. 

“He’s not having it. He’s the face of the evening news and nothing about him ever makes it into the papers. He’s very private and no one at ABC likes the way Amy and T.J. handled it,” a source told Page Six. 

According to another insider, “every anchor is upset that Amy and T.J. have caused such drama.”

“No one wants to be associated with this, and Amy and David already aren’t that close right now,” they said. 

An ABC News spokesperson told us of the “World News Tonight with David Muir” anchor, “David is focused on the work, not any of this,” when we reached out for comment.

The network’s initial response was to ignore it, but Holmes and Robach didn’t follow orders and joked on-air about having a “great week” after their affair was exposed. 

Multiple sources told us people at the network are “very unhappy” with the comment. “If the decision is to not address it, then don’t address it! T.J. made light of it on-air. Amy’s smarter than that, but how else is she supposed to respond?” the first source said.  

We hear Robach also isn’t a fan of all of the attention the affair is getting, especially after she fought so hard to become co-anchor of “20/20.”

“She’s a serious hard news journalist, and this is a major distraction,” one TV insider noted.

“Becoming co-anchor of ’20/20′ was very important to her. She was obsessed with getting that job. This affair is bringing her down and changing her reputation,” they added. 

The details of their affair have created such a diversion, that even rival CBS anchor Gayle King chimed in by calling it all “very messy.”

“I think, to me, it’s just a sad situation because you’ve got kids involved, you’ve got families involved, and I keep thinking about that. I’m very concerned about that,” King told Andy Cohen on “Watch What Happens Live.”

Coincidentally, we broke the news that Holmes also had an affair with former “GMA” producer Natasha Singh — who is now a producer on King’s CBS show. 

Holmes and Robach were yanked off-air, and we hear that ABC is investigating other potential affairs in the workplace. 

A rep for the couple did not comment.
