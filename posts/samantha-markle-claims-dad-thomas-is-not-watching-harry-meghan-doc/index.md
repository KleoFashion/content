Thomas Markle will be avoiding his daughter Meghan Markle and her husband Prince Harry’s new docuseries, “Harry & Meghan,” according to his other daughter, Samantha Markle.

Meghan’s half-sister told TMZ on Saturday that her father is more focused on his health and she’s protecting him from watching the “disrespectful” Netflix documentary.

Samantha, 58, also told the outlet she doesn’t think Thomas — who is recovering from a stroke he suffered earlier this year — would even want to watch the series because the royal family drama has been damaging to his health.

In “Harry & Meghan,” which was released on Thursday, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke candidly about their alienated relationship with both Thomas, 78, and Samantha.

A statement shown in the episode read, “Samantha Markle maintains that she and Meghan had a close relationship until 2018 and that the media fabricated quotes that have been attributed to her.”

“My half-sister, who I hadn’t seen for over a decade — and that was only for a day and a half — suddenly, it felt like she was everywhere,” the former “Suits” actress said.

“I don’t know your middle name. I don’t know your birthday. You’re telling these people that you raised me, and you’ve coined me ‘Princess Pushy,’” she added.

In the documentary, Meghan said she was urged by the royal family’s communications staff to contact Thomas to see if he was colluding with the media, alleging that he was taking money to stage photos.

“H and I called my dad. I said, ‘Look, they’re saying you’re taking money from the tabloids to stage photos. Is this true?’ He says no,” she recalled.

The mom of two said she offered to have someone come out to Mexico to relocate her father before the media swarmed his home after the story came out.

I was like, ‘I don’t know why, but I don’t believe him.'”

In the week leading up to Harry and Meghan’s May 2018 nuptials, Thomas stopped answering their phone calls.

“Instead, you’re talking to TMZ. And I’m finding out that you’re not coming to our wedding through a tabloid,” the “Archetypes” podcast host said.

“Of course, it’s incredibly sad what happened,” he said in the docuseries’ third episode. “She had a father before this and now she doesn’t have a father.”

Meghan last communicated with her father via text while he was recovering from heart surgery before her and Harry tied the knot.

The first three episodes of “Harry & Meghan” are now streaming on Netflix.
