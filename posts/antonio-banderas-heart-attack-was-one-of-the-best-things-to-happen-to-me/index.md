After having a heart attack in 2017, Antonio Banderas has re-prioritized the things in life that are most important to him.

He exclusively tells Page Six that he realized it was the best thing that has ever happened in his life because he realized that the things he was worrying about every day were meaningless.

"I wondered why I should be worried about that if I was going to die?" he asks. I always knew I would die, but now I know. I've seen it."

In addition, he began to detach from "things that I thought were important before but weren't really important" like his daughter Stella, Melanie Griffith, friends, family, and his "vocation as an actor."

In January 2017, the 62-year-old Spanish actor suffered a heart attack and he credits his longtime girlfriend Nicole Kimpel for saving his life by giving him an aspirin as soon as she noticed he had a problem. 

In March that year, he said the incident was not serious and did not cause any damage, but he underwent a procedure to place three stents in his arteries.

He told press at the time, "It hasn't been as dramatic as some."

Banderas will soon be seen reprising his role as Puss in Boots in "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish," in which Puss realizes he has burned through eight of his nine lives and embarks on a quest to find the mythical last wish.

As an Oscar nominee, he shares that he's had his share of down moments as well, but they don't last too long since he's a "very positive person by nature. My depressions last five minutes, and I bounce back immediately afterward."

Banderas, who is currently appearing on stage in Madrid with "Company," has also hinted that he may return to Broadway after winning the Tony for "Nine" in 2003.

In the midst of our conversation, he teases, "Something has been written as we speak," he says, adding that the character is going to make sense with his iberian accent.

"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish" opens Dec. 21.
