A rep for Megan Thee Stallion says her former bodyguard is missing ahead of her court appearance against Tory Lanez.

In the ongoing assault trial against Lanez for shooting Megan in the foot in 2020, Justin Edison, a former member of the rapper's security team, will testify next week.

However, Edison's testimony appeared to be in jeopardy on Saturday, according to Megan Thee Stallion's attorney. 

Alex Spiro told TMZ Saturday that Justin Edison went missing just before he was scheduled to appear in court.

As per Spiro, the LAPD is "currently investigating" Edison's disappearance, although a spokesperson for the department said to The Post that Edison's case has not been opened as a missing person's case.

Asked if it was wrong to refer to Edison as a criminal by saying that the police were on the lookout for him, the spokesperson replied, "Yeah, because it makes him seem like a criminal."

There has been no word from Edison's attorney since Thursday, according to a source in The Shade Room.

After leaving Kylie Jenner's house after a party in 2020, Lanez allegedly shot Megan. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. There are three charges against him: assault with a firearm, illegal possession of a firearm, and negligent discharge of a firearm.

Megan testified on Tuesday that Lanz shot her after they left the party and after an argument concerning a love triangle erupted on the ride home.

Megan's friend Kelsey Harris and Lanez's bodyguard were in the car when she asked to be let out. He then allegedly fired several shots at her, shouting, "Dance, bitch!"

In September, Harris told prosecutors that Lanz shot Megan that night and texted Megan's manager, "Help. Tory shot meg. 911.". She testified on Wednesday that she did not witness Megan being shot by Lanz.

According to Lanez's team, Megan and Harris were involved in the shooting.
