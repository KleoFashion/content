One of Megan Thee Stallion's former bodyguards has disappeared ahead of her scheduled appearance in court, a rep said.

In the ongoing assault trial against Lanez for allegedly shooting Megan in the foot in 2020, Justin Edison, a former member of the rapper's security team, is scheduled to testify next week.

Edison's testimony, however, appeared to be in jeopardy on Saturday, according to Megan Thee Stallion's attorney. 

Justin Edison went missing right before he was supposed to appear in court, his lawyer, Alex Spiro, told TMZ Saturday.

As per Spiro, the LAPD is "currently investigating his disappearance," but a spokesperson confirmed to The Post that Edison has not been listed as a missing person.

The spokesperson responded, "Yeah, because it makes Edison look like a criminal."

Edison's attorney hasn't heard from him since Thursday, according to The Shade Room.

After leaving Kylie Jenner's house after a party in 2020, Lanez allegedly shot Megan. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. It is alleged that he assaulted the victim with a firearm, possessed a firearm illegally, and discharged the weapon negligently.

After an argument on the ride home concerning a love triangle erupted, Megan testified Tuesday that Lanz shot her because he was upset they had left the party.

Megan said Lanez's bodyguard and Megan's friend Kelsey Harris were in the car when she asked to be let out. Lanez then allegedly fired several shots at her while shouting, "dance, bitch!"

In September, Harris told prosecutors that Lanz fired the gun and texted Megan's manager, "Help. Tory shot meg. 911.". She testified Wednesday that she didn't see Lanz shoot Megan.

There has been speculation that Megan and Harris were involved in the shooting, as suggested by Lanez's team.
