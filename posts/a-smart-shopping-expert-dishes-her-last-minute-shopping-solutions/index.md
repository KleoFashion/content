In October, Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, and others held large sales events that began the holiday shopping season. As retailers attempt to clear out excess inventory and incentivize consumers to shop, Trae Bodge states that discounting continues to be aggressive.

Foot traffic on Black Friday was up year-over-year, and online shopping surpassed records over Cyber Weekend - up 2% on Black Friday and 6% on Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation.

### Gifts are available

While some things will sell out, Bodge says we're not having supply chain issues like in recent years, so stock issues shouldn't be a big deal. You'd be better off shopping in-store, so you don't risk shipping delays. Or give digital gifts."

### Digital gifts you love

The number one preferred gift during the holidays is cash, especially in light of record-breaking inflation. You can send your recipients a last-minute cash gift by using PayPal and Venmo peer-to-peer payments. A holiday-themed digital gift wrap and a note to express your holiday message can add a personal touch. ”

Among Bodge's favorite subscription services are the multi-month subscription boxes. She thinks they create a sense of discovery for the recipient and they cover a variety of interests, from food to fitness to STEM for kids and everything in between. The best way to find discounts on experiential gifts is to use Groupon - they offer great deals on experiential gift cards."

### Savings

Toys, holiday-themed items, gifts sets, and winter apparel are expected to experience the deepest discounts. You might also want to check out deal sites like Slickdeals.net because I'm seeing a lot of exciting promotional activity there as well. A handy browser extension serves up cashback offers and coupons as you browse the web with millions of shoppers using Slickdeals.”
