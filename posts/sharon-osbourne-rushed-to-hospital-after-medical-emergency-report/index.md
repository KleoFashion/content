Sharon Osbourne has reportedly been hospitalized after suffering a medical emergency while on set for a new TV show.

The former “Talk” host, 70, “fell ill” while filming for a paranormal show at the Glen Tavern Inn in Santa Paula, Calif., on Friday, according to TMZ.

A spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department also told TMZ that they received a “medical call” from the tavern at around 6:30 p.m. local time.

Osbourne was reportedly taken to Santa Paula Hospital. 

Her current medical condition is unknown.

Osbourne’s rep did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.

It is unclear what could have caused the former “X Factor” judge to get sick as she opened up about any major health struggles recently.

However, in May, Osbourne revealed on Instagram that she contracted COVID-19.

At the time, she posted a photo of herself receiving aid via an IV drip and gave a peace sign from bed.

Soon after, though, Osbourne was back to work, appearing on television in the UK.

Over the summer, the “Charm School” alum had actually been tending to her husband, Ozzy Osbourne, after a “life-altering” back surgery.

“Our family would like to express so much gratitude for the overwhelming amount of love and support leading up to Ozzy’s surgery,” Sharon wrote via her Instagram Stories in June.

“Ozzy is doing well and on the road to recovery! Your love means the world to him.”

Sharon and Ozzy have been married since 1982.
