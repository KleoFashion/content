Here's the first Barbie teaser trailer
======================================

Is it just a neon-splattered fever dream? 

When Barbie comes out in July 2023, do you think we'll all be sick of singing "let's go party!" by the time she actually makes an appearance on the big screen? There's no question that this isn't an entirely unfair question, considering the fact that the film has already been teased for some time now. It's been a long time since the first Barbie teaser dropped, even though the first trailer just dropped.

It wasn't long ago that the internet couldn't stop obsessing over images of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling rollerblading on Venice Beach in neon 'fits, spray-tanned to golden California deliciousness. Despite rumours for years, Robbie was confirmed to play the iconic Mattel doll in April. However, according to Entertainment Weekly, the film itself has been in the works since 2014 (!) and is going to be a live-action adaptation of Barbie World. Check out the scoop on the buzzy Barbie movie, plus everything else you need to know.

What is the release date for Barbie?
------------------------------------

A release date of July 21, 2023 has been set for the film.

What is the name of the actress who will be starring in the live-action Barbie movie?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the film directed by Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie plays the titular doll and Ryan Gosling plays (who else?) Ken. There is a seriously star-studded cast, some of whom appear in the teaser trailer. Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Hari Nef, Issa Rae, Canadian Simu Liu and Kate McKinnon also star.

Amy Schumer was supposed to play Barbie, wasn't she?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes, that's correct. As part of Sony's development of a new feminist take on the famous 1950s doll, Schumer was cast as the blonde doll in 2016. In 2017, the comedian left the project due to "creative differences," while Sony reportedly pursued Anne Hathaway for the role. After more delays, the film was moved from Warner Bros. to Warner Independent and Gerwig, who is famous for directing Lady Bird and Little Women, stepped in to direct the film.

Barbie's teaser trailer: what happens?
--------------------------------------

You can see for yourself below, but basically nothing...and everything. Margot Robbie's Barbie emerges from a dusty desert at dawn, wearing a classic striped bather and open-toe mules. In this hairstyle, the bangs are curled extremely tightly. There's a flash of Ryan Gosling in a fringed leather vest with a 10-pack of bronzed abs. Simu Liu and Issa Rae appear briefly in dance numbers. Additionally, there is a picture of Barbie looking out into a very pink Barbie world (Barbieland? Barbieverse?). We don't see Barbie's RV but then again, most of it flashes so quickly that it's more like a fever dream than a Barbie teaser.

Keep an eye out for more as the production rolls out. Life in plastic is awesome.
