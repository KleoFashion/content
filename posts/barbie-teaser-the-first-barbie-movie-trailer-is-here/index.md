Here's the first Barbie teaser trailer
======================================

Maybe it's just a neon-splattered fever dream? 

By the time Barbie actually comes out in July 2023, will we all be sick of singing "Come on Barbie, let's party?"? The question is not entirely unfair, considering how long the film has been teased. Even though Barbie's first official teaser just dropped, the film has been in its hype phase for much longer.

It wasn't long ago that the internet couldn't stop obsessing over images of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling rollerblading on Venice Beach in neon 'fits, spray-tanned to golden California deliciousness. It was confirmed in April that Robbie was going to be the iconic Mattel doll, a casting that had been rumored for a very long time. But the movie itself has been in the works since 2014 (! ), according to Entertainment Weekly. Here's everything you need to know about the buzzy Barbie movie.

Is Barbie coming out soon?
--------------------------

In 2023, the film will be released.

Barbie's live-action movie stars who?
-------------------------------------

Margot Robbie plays the title character in the film directed by Greta Gerwig, and Ryan Gosling plays Ken in the film, which was co-written by Gosling and Robbie. Along with the plastic power couple, the teaser trailer also features a star-studded cast. A few of the actors included are Issa Rae, Canadian Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, America Ferrera, Hari Nef, and Will Ferrell.

Didn't Amy Schumer originally intend to play Barbie?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes, that's correct. Sony initially approached Schumer to star as the blonde doll in 2016 when the film was being developed. In 2017, the comedian stepped away from the project due to "creative differences," with Sony rumoured to be wooing Anne Hathaway. In 2019, it moved to Warner Bros. and Gerwig, who directed Lady Bird and Little Women, took over directing.

Do you know what happens in the Barbie teaser trailer?
------------------------------------------------------

Here's what you can see for yourself, but basically nothing...and everything. She's wearing a classic striped bather and open-toe mules, dressed in a dusty desert at the dawn of time. Bangs are curled super tight. We see Ryan Gosling in a fringed leather vest with bronzed abs peeking out. A few snippets of Issa Rae and Simu Liu's dance numbers are shown. Oh, and a very pink Barbie world (Barbieland? Barbieverse?) behind Barbie. We don't get to see the Barbie RV, but then again, most of it flashes so quickly, it feels more like a fever dream than a Barbie teaser.

As the production rolls out more in the months to come, stay tuned. Life in plastic is amazing, after all.
