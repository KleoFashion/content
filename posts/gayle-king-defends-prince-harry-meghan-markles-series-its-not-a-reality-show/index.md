According to Gayle King, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's new docuseries, "Harry & Meghan," is not a reality show.

Andy Cohen joked about Markle previously saying she would never do a reality show on "Watch What Happens Live" on Thursday, prompting the anchor to quickly rectify his mistake.

"I can't wait" to watch Thursday's Netflix docuseries, added the award-winning journalist.

She said she was optimistic that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would reconcile with the rest of the royals after Queen Elizabeth II passed away on Sept. 8.

On Sept. 19, after Her Majesty's funeral, she told "Extra" that both sides had attempted to make things right.

Let's see how it goes."

Are they going to be drawn closer together or apart? According to King. Honestly, I don't know. I don't have any inside information on that, but I can tell you one thing: I was glad to see Harry standing with his family. I wanted to see him as strong as he could be."
