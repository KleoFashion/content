King shared her optimism that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would reconcile with the rest of the royal family after Queen Elizabeth II passed away on Sept. 8.

There have been efforts on both sides to sort of make this right, she told "Extra" after Her Majesty's funeral on Sept. 19, which was attended by thousands of people.

"Let's wait and see how it goes."

Will they get closer or farther apart?‚Äù He said. "I don't know. I don't have inside information, but I will tell you this: I was glad to see Harry standing with his family."
