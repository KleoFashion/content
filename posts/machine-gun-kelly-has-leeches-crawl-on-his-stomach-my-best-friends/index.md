It is not only Megan Fox who desires the blood of Machine Gun Kelly.

On Friday, the "Bloody Valentine" singer uploaded a video to his Instagram Stories showing a group of leeches crawling over his naked stomach.

"My best friends," Kelly wrote.

According to the National Library of Medicine, leeches have been used for therapeutic purposes since the beginning of civilization, but MGK did not explain why he had his new pals on him.

A number of studies have found that leeches can help with a wide range of health issues, including inflammation, bleeding, neurological system abnormalities, skin diseases, dental complications, and problems with the urinary and reproductive systems.

There are other bloodsuckers in MGK's life apart from the leeches that feed on his blood.

In January, when the "Emo Girl" singer announced his engagement to Fox, 36, they revealed that they drink each other's blood. 

"Transformers" star later clarified that they only consume it for "ritual purposes."

In April, Fox told Glamour UK, "So, I guess "drinking" each other's blood might mislead people or may evoke images of us with goblets drinking each other's blood like in "Game of Thrones."."

"On occasion, we do consume each other's blood for ritual purposes only."

Furthermore, Fox said that she practices astrology and meditation as well as "all these metaphysical practices."

The "Jennifer's Body" star said she does rituals on new and full moons. 

In other words, when I do it, it's a passageway or it's going to be used for a reason. So it's a controlled process where it's going to be like, 'Let's shed a few drops of blood and drink it together.'"

In addition to drinking each other's bodily fluids, MGK and Fox both confessed to wearing vials containing their own blood as necklaces as well as drinking each other's bodily fluids.

It was Kelly who wrote on Valentine's Day 2021 via Instagram, “I wear your blood around my neck. ”
