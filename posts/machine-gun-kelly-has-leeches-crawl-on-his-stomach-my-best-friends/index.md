It's not just Megan Fox who wants Machine Gun Kelly's blood.

On Friday, the "Bloody Valentine" singer shared a video via his Instagram Stories showing a group of leeches crawling over his bare stomach.

Kelly wrote, "My best friends.".

According to the National Library of Medicine, leeches have been used as therapeutic tools since the beginning of civilization.

Leeches have been shown to help with inflammation, bleeding, nervous system disorders, skin diseases, dental complications, and problems with the urinary system and reproductive system, according to research.

The leeches aren't MGK's only bloodsuckers.

The "Emo Girl" singer and Fox, 36, announced their engagement in January. 

As later clarified by the "Transformers" star, the substance is only consumed by them for the purpose of "ritual."

"So, I guess 'drinking' each other's blood might mislead people, or people think we're drinking each other's blood like from 'Game of Thrones,'" Fox told Glamour UK in April.

We do consume each other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes only."

She also does "all these metaphysical practices and meditations" according to Fox.

"I do rituals on new moons and full moons, as well as all these things," Jennifer's Body's star revealed. 

In fact, it's a passage or it's used for a purpose. It's controlled in that it's like, "Let's shed a few drops of blood and drink it together."

Furthermore, MGK and Fox have admitted to wearing vials of each other's blood as necklaces in addition to drinking their bodily fluids.

On Valentine's Day 2021, Kelly wrote, “I wear your blood around my neck. ”
