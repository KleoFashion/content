It's true that she's not wrapped in plastic, but she's fantastic. 

This morning, the much-anticipated "Barbie" teaser trailer was released, showing Margot Robbie wearing Barbie's iconic bathing suit. 

"Wolf of Wall Street" star Joel Edgerton's rendition of Barbie is introduced in the playful clip, wearing a black and white one-piece strapless bathing suit, vintage white frame sunglasses, and curly bangs, towering over children with dolls as they play with them. 

This Barbie re-creates the 1959 poolside Barbie, who accessorizes her zebra suit with blue eyeshadow and gold hoop earrings, one of the most sought-after dolls.

You can get a reproduction of the doll on Amazon for $113 right now.

It is also revealed in the teaser that Ryan Gosling, 42, who has a tan and is shirtless as Ken, is also seen briefly, looking like an action star from the 80s, as well as Simu Liu and Issa Rae.

During the premiere of the new film "La La Land," the actor is seen in an open black fringed vest adorned with a matching headband, accessorized with a silver necklace and gold chain on his pants, showing off his many abs. 

A later shot from the teaser shows Robbie, 32, in a silver sequined strapless ensemble with big, bouncy waves and a pink and white gingham dress.

In hot pink, the star's Barbie was spotted wearing coordinating western wear over the summer. 

Skating through Venice Beach, they wore matching neon rollerblades and patterned athleisure.

Liu recently opened up about his preparation for the film, in which he's rumored to play another Ken doll. In order to achieve the hairless appearance, he waxed his entire body, describing it as "the most painful experience of my life."

Seeing the Greta Gerwig-directed film on the big screen (in theaters on July 21, 2023) will certainly make all the effort worthwhile.
