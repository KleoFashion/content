On Friday, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky went on a beach date with their son in Malibu, Calif. They're revealing their baby boy tomorrow.

As the couple made sure to keep their 7-month-old baby warm, the 34-year-old singer of "Diamonds" and 34-year-old rapper of "Praise the Lord" were spotted acting like doting parents toward one another.

A camera crew was present, so it may have been a scenic photo shoot for the family.

Black, flowing dress with a slit showed off Rihanna's long legs. Flowing in the wind, her hair was styled with its natural texture.

Rocky wore an all-black leather outfit, which included a vest, pants, and jacket, while the couple's son was mostly topless.

In his embrace with his son, the rapper of the song "F-kin' Problems" looked giddy.

The baby, whose name has not yet been revealed, is the first child for both Rocky and Rihanna, who are in their early 30s.

After a highly publicized pregnancy, the couple welcomed their son in May.

It has been the couple's decision to keep their little one away from the public eye since he was born - and it will continue until Saturday, at the earliest.

In her first TikTok video, Rihanna shared a cute clip of her baby in his car seat.

"You trying to get mommy's phone?" the singer asks as the baby grabs the phone, adding, "Oh, wow. Oh, wow."

The reason for Rihanna's decision to go public with her son is unclear following paparazzi photographs taken of her family at the beach a day earlier.

Page Six requested a comment from a spokesperson for the CEO of Fenty Beauty, but the spokesperson did not respond immediately.
