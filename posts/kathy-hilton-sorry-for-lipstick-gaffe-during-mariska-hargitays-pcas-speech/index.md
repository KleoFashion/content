Kathy Hilton is apologizing for applying her lip gloss onstage while Mariska Hargitay gave an impassioned acceptance speech at the 2022 People’s Choice Awards.

“I adore and I respect Mariska very much,” the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star, 63, told Extra on Friday. “I already reached out to her, DMed her, I want to get her address, I feel terrible.”

She added, “I apologize, Mariska, I am really sorry … I look forward to talking to you.”

Hilton said that she “would never do anything to be rude intentionally,” adding that it was the first time “being back on the stage with some of the girls,” referencing her “RHOBH” co-stars.

The socialite admitted that she was actually looking for a tissue because she felt like she had to sneeze.

Hilton reunited with her co-stars — Dorit Kemsley, Sutton Stracke, Lisa Rinna, Erika Jayne, Kyle Richards and Crystal Minkoff — at the PCAs to present the award for Best Drama TV Star.

After Hargitay, 58, was named the winner, the “Law & Order: SVU” actress took the stage and began giving a rousing speech about empowerment.

“I just want to celebrate our ability in all of us, the willingness in all of us, to choose kindness, and compassion and courage, and to choose to listen and to learn and to build a bridge between our differences and our divides,” Hargitay said in part.

Fans took to social media to call out the Casa Del Sol tequila investor for her behavior. 

“I love Mariska Hargitay. Such a bizarre moment as Kathy Hilton reapplies lipstick during her beautiful acceptance speech,” one person tweeted.

Another wrote, “Mariska is eternal, Olivia Benson 100% in television history’s godhead, beautiful speech and — dafuq Kathy Hilton, you can’t wait two minutes to touch up your lips?”

Meanwhile, Hilton’s pal Stracke recently came to her defense, telling Page Six exclusively, “I think she thought that the camera was not on her. I think that she thought the camera was off of her.”
