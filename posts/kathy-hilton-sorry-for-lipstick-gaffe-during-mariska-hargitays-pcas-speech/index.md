At the 2022 People's Choice Awards, Kathy Hilton apologized for applying lip gloss onstage while Mariska Hargitay delivered an impassioned acceptance speech.

In an interview with Extra on Friday, Mariska said, "I love and respect her very much.". I've already DMed her, I want her address, I feel terrible."

I'm sorry, Mariska, I'm really sorry ... I'm looking forward to talking to you."

"I would never be rude intentionally," Hilton said, adding that it was her first time on stage with the "RHOBH" girls.

She admitted that she was actually looking for a tissue because she felt the need to sneeze.

Because it was during her speech, I thought the camera wouldn't be on me."

At the PCAs, Hilton presented the Best Drama TV Star award with her co-stars Dorit Kemsley, Sutton Stracke, Lisa Rinna, Erika Jayne, Kyle Richards, and Crystal Minkoff.

Hargitay, 58, took the stage shortly after she was announced the winner and began delivering a stirring speech about empowerment.

As Hargitay put it, "I just want to celebrate our collective ability to choose kindness, compassion, and courage, as well as our willingness to listen and to learn and to build a bridge between our differences and divides."

She got called out on social media for her behavior by fans. 

A tweet said, "I love Mariska Hargitay. Such a bizarre moment when Kathy Hilton reapplies lipstick during her beautiful acceptance speech."

“Mariska is eternal, Olivia Benson is 100% in television history’s godhead, you can’t wait two minutes to touch up your lips, dafuq Kathy Hilton?”?

In the meantime, Hilton's pal Stracke spoke out for her, telling Page Six exclusively, "I think she thought the camera wasn't on her."
